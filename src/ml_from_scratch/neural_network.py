"""
This module will implement neural network from scratch with Back Propagation:
1. Forward-propagation to calculate the error/loss
2. Gradient
3. Back propagation to update the weights

Modelling as Classification problem:
1. Tutorial link: https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/
2. Dataset link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds
